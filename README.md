# thewall.life

**thewall.life** is a lightweight, containerized message wall application built with a DevOps-first mindset.  
The application itself is intentionally simple, while the focus is on clean architecture, containerization, and CI/CD automation.

### CI/CD (Jenkins)

The project uses Jenkins Pipeline as Code.

Pipeline flow:

1. GitHub checkout

2. Docker image build

3. Deployment using Docker Compose

A push to the main branch triggers an automated redeploy.

---

### Configuration

Environment variables:

Variable	Purpose
REACT_APP_API_URL	Backend API URL
DATABASE_URL	Database connection string

Configured via Docker Compose and Jenkins.

---

### Health & Stability

- Backend health endpoint: /health

- Docker health checks ensure proper startup order

- Nginx used for frontend stability and performance

---

### Production Notes

- SQLite is sufficient for low traffic and demos

- Architecture supports easy migration to PostgreSQL

- Easily extensible with HTTPS, reverse proxy, or Kubernetes

---

### Author Notes

This project demonstrates real-world DevOps practices:

- Clear service separation

- Repeatable deployments

- Infrastructure as code

- Minimal manual intervention

Simple application. Solid execution.
